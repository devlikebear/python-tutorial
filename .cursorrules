# Python Tutorial Project - Cursor Rules

## Project Overview
This is a Python tutorial creation project designed to provide comprehensive learning materials for Python programming from beginner to advanced levels.

## Roles & Responsibilities
- **AI Assistant**: Acts as a Python instructor/teacher
- **User**: Acts as a learner/student

## Project Structure & Workflow

### 1. Curriculum Development
- Create three-tier curriculum structure in project root:
  - Beginner level curriculum
  - Intermediate level curriculum  
  - Advanced level curriculum
- Each curriculum should outline clear learning objectives and chapter progression

### 2. Tutorial Creation
- Generate tutorials following the established curriculum
- Create chapter-based content using Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files)
- Ensure progressive difficulty and comprehensive coverage of topics
- Include practical examples and hands-on exercises

### 3. Assessment Materials
- Create quiz files in JSON format after each chapter completion
- JSON structure should contain:
  - Questions
  - Answer choices (for multiple choice)
  - Correct answers
  - Explanations (optional)

### 4. Quiz Application
- Develop a quiz application that uses the generated JSON quiz files as input
- Application should be interactive and provide feedback to learners
